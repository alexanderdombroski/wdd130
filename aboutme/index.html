    <p>Hi! I'm working towards getting my computer science degree. I love hiking, playing board games, and playing spikeball. I'm making this website in my web design class. I hope this will build on my overall knowlege of computer science and make me a better programmer. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and have been ever since I was young. I love the scripture "Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not." D&C 6:36</p>
    <p>Thanks for visiting my website!</p>
